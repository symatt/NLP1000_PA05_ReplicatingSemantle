    "We took a straight forward approach in implementing the program. After looking into the data set and familiarizing ourselves with the datatypes and features that are going to work with, we started reading up on the gensim library and which pre-made functions we can use for the program. The program starts off by getting a random word from the vocabulary we considered the difficulty of the program when the winning word to be guessed had punctuations in it or numbers and settled on the decision that the winning word should only consist of letters. It then gets the cosine similarity of the winning word to all the words in the vocabulary, the variable holding the similarities of the word to all the words is then appended along with each compared word to an array with the first dimension being the word and the second dimension containing the cosine similarity of the word to the winning word. The array is then sorted according to the cosine similarity in a descending order and the program prints the 9th, 99th, and 999th index to show the 10th, 100th, and 1000th closest word to the winning word according to cosine similarity. Finally, the program asks the user for an input and this input is checked for its cosine similarity to the winning word. The program ends when the winning word is guessed by the user."

    "After observing the program work on two different pre-trained word embeddings the dimensions of the pre-trained embedding doesn't seem to matter all that much. It could be that since the dimensions of the embedding are a hyperparameter to be tuned the difference is minimal however it is good to note that while increasing the dimension may increase the accuracy it comes at the cost of computational complexity."

    "What stood out the most for all of us was the ease of use of the gensim functions where almost everything we needed to access the model were already there. The project has motivated us to learn more about how words are embedded and the exact process in which the model learns to relate the similarity and dissimilarity various different words. This experience has reinforced our knowledge about vector semantics and more specifically word similarity by letting us experience the application of it first hand. The implementation of the program is the roughly the same as semantle however it varies slightly, an example of this is when giving the hints the program immediately gives out the 10th, 100th, and 1000th closest word while in semantle it slowly reveals words closer to the word itself and only the top 1000 closest words are taken into account when guessing, while in the program all the words even cold ones show the exact similarity.
